- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndreasOhligsch a Software Developer based in Leipzig, Germany.

💼 Over the course of my three-year qualification at AAIC Soft Systems, I gained comprehensive insights into the workings of an IT company. I developed my skills in using Microsoft's .NET Framework with C# and VB, crafting customized ERP and CRM solutions. This involved employing tools like Sage AppDesigner for UI construction and ReportDesigner for automating the printing of billing documents. Additionally, I picked up foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which ignited my interest in web development.

🚀 Post-qualification, my career took me to various companies where I expanded my expertise in ASP.NET, Entity Framework, React, GraphQL, Next.js, and Sass. I also continued to advance my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🎓 I recently completed a one-year MERN Stack Bootcamp, which has shifted my focus toward full-stack development. Although I am well-versed in Object-Oriented Programming, my recent endeavors have concentrated on mastering the MERN Stack.

🌐 My interests currently lie in further exploring technologies such as TypeScript, Angular, Vue, PHP, and Python. I aim to build web applications that are both high-performing and maintain clean code.

🔍 I stay informed of the latest trends in software architecture and technology, and I am eager to delve into the realms of DevOps, Microservices Architecture, Docker, and Kubernetes. Prior to that, my goal is to broaden my proficiency in diverse programming languages.
