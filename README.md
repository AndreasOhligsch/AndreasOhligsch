- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AndreasOhligsch a Software Developer based in Leipzig, Germany.
- During my 3 Year Qualification at AAIC Soft Systems to become a Software Developer, I learned all about the internal processes of an IT Company and how to use Microsoft's .NET Framework with both C# and VB to build customized ERP- and CRM- Solutions, using Tools from Sage such as the Sage AppDesigner to build the UI and the ReportDesigner to provide Solutions for automated printing of billing documents. During those 3 Years, I also learned a bit about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had the opportunity to design the intranet and to create a game of my choice using Javascript. It was then that I decided to dive deeper into web development and find a way to become a Web Developer. 
- After my Qualification, I worked for different companies, aquiring knowledge in ASP.NET, Entity Framework, React, GraphQL, NextJS and Sass and expanding my knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- ðŸŒ± I recently finished a 1-year MERN Stack Bootcamp. 
- Although I have a good understanding of Object Oriented Programming, in the past 1,5 Years I have focused on learning the MERN Stack, which is why I'm currently more proficient in the MERN Stack than in the .NET World, but I'm willing to dive back into .NET in its latest version.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Typescript, Angular, Vue, PHP and Python and in building fast and responsive Web Applications with clean code. 
- I also like to keep an eye on Software Architecture topics and latest trends in technology.
- I'm keen to learn about DevOps, the Microservices Architecture, Docker and Kubernetes, but first I want to expand my knwoledge in different programming languages.
