- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndreasOhligsch
- 👀 I’m interested in building fast and responsive Web Applications and writting clean code. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN Stack, but I'm also looking forward to learn Angular and Vue and other Frameworks in order to become a more flexible Frontend Developer. I have some experience in C#, which is why I'm also interested in Typescript. I also like to keep an eye on Software Architecture topics and latest trends in technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: andreas_ohl_t@hotmail.com
